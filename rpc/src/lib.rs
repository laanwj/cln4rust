//! Crate that provides an RPC binding from rust code to the c-lightning daemon
//!
//! This create provides both a high and a low-level interface.
//! Most likely, you'll want to use the high-level interface through `LightningRPC`, as this is
//! most convenient,
//! but it is also possible to construct Request and Response objects manually and
//! send them through the pipe.
